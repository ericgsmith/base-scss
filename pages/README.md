#Pages

While in a perfect world we aim for modifier classes to alter the behaviour, some
times we find the need to make use of Drupal's top level page classes.

It is important to remember that a page is made up of components, so we shouldn't
aim to add too much styling in these partials.

So examples are:

- extending component placeholders onto Drupal "fugly" selectors
- page specific overrides based on Drupal page level classes.
