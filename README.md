#SCSS Scaffold

This project contains a set of recommended partials and folder structure for 
starting a project from. Some of this is Drupal influenced, but can be used 
outside of Drupal.

Each folder contains a README file explaining the reasoning behind it's existance.

There is minimal CSS in place, as the idea is to be an minimal as possible while
still conveying the importance of a clean and well understood folder structure.

This project makes no assumption about your naming conventions, task runner workflow
or anything other than the folder strucutre of your project.

The READMEs should be modified and updated to reflect your project's CSS approach
should you chose to use this.
